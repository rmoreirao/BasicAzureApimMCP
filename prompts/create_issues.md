I need to create a sample MCP server using Fast MCP with Python: #fetch  https://fastmcp.wiki/en/getting-started/quickstart

Don't implement anything yet. 
You are a senior Python developer specifying a new MCP server.
Break down the requirements below into GitHub issues - add extra details that you may think it is necessary.
Create the GitHub issues required to complete these tasks using the #issue_write tool.

Code:
- Code must be on "src/mcp" folder.
- requirements.txt file must be created.
- MCP client must expose a simple tool called "sum", it receives 2 numbers and returns the sum of these numbers.
- Create MD file with docs about the code and running it.

Tests:
- Code must be on "src/test" folder.
- Create a simple test to validate that the function works correctly.
- Create docs for the tests in MD format, describe the tests and how to execute them.
